    <p>Many years ago, Bill Bonnstetter and his son David developed a
        revolutionary software system based on the DISC method—a way of
        describing human communication and classifying behavior and the method
        that is used throughout this book. Sadly, Bill has since passed away, but
        David continues to run their company—TTI Success Insights—to this day.
        From its humble origins in rural Iowa, this method of behavior profiling
        has now been used by businesses and corporations all around the world.
        It all began with one question. A simple, specific question: Could an
        agricultural salesperson sell more seed simply by looking at a farm?
        As a child growing up in rural Iowa, I watched my father apply the
        foundational principles of William Moulton Marston’s Emotions of Normal
        People. At the time, my father was focused on Buyer Profile Blending,
        giving agricultural salespeople the knowledge of Marston’s tools to better
        understand themselves and their farmer customers. I can still recall the
        earliest days, sitting at a knotty-pine table over meals of hot pork
        tenderloins and roast corn, when my father was working through his
        observations. “Pristine driveways and neat groves? Definitely a Blue. New
        and experimental livestock and buildings? You’re looking at a Red.”
        Although we were close, our paths were incredibly different. My father,
        a true entrepreneur and Red/Yellow in every sense of the phrase, was driven
        to build consulting firms and agencies that helped salespeople refine their
        craft. I sought the collegiate path, attending university at the University of
        Iowa, leaning into my Red/Blue nature while studying accounting and
        computer science. I spent my free time in the computer lab, pouring my
        
        soul into programs through my fingertips. While I was studying, my father
        perfected his wizardlike ability to understand people.
        My father and I always remained close and spoke to each other most
        weeks, even though we were at different milestones in our lives. While I
        was studying at the University of Iowa, my father sat me down and asked
        me about contributing to his venture. He asked, “What if we could couple
        your ability to develop software with my ability to analyze human
        behavior?” I was ambitious, hungry for fun coding work, and proceeded to
        embark on the most exciting journey of my life. Together, we built a
        software system that would produce reports about human behavior. This
        was a multiplying factor; soon we were able to reach more people and
        
        reveal a person’s potential through 3.5-inch floppy disks and twenty-four-
        page reports. My father and I built a company, TTI Success Insights, in
        
        1984 in Iowa to do just that.
        Over time, we escaped the frigid winters in the Midwest of the United
        States, relocated ourselves, our families, and our business to sunny and
        warm Scottsdale, Arizona. In the late nineties, we began using the web for
        distribution of our famed assessments. Today, we have a thriving business
        with distributors all over the world.
        Up until now, you might have wondered why you are so different.
        Human behavior is, for the most part, complex and nebulous. In some
        cases, the people around us are idiotic. Understanding human behavior is a
        never-ending task, an endless pursuit to know the how, what, and why
        behind a person’s choices. It is both easy and dangerous to categorize
        someone who behaves differently from you as ignorant, wrong, or even
        thickheaded. Today’s world requires a more sophisticated understanding
        where you value a person for his or her strengths and weaknesses.
        My father has since passed on. But the purpose we invoked, to reveal
        human potential, continues to live on. This book is written about the
        concepts my father applied in sales trainings and applies them to an even
        more complex situation—understanding the idiots who surround us all.
        As you read, I think you will understand the worth of a Red, a Yellow, a
        Green, and a Blue. I hope you will pull away some practical advice in
        communicating effectively with each type. But the most important lesson
        
        that you can walk away with is that the idiots who surround you are, in fact,
        not idiots at all. Instead, they are individuals worthy of respect,
        understanding, and being valued.
        Anyone can use the frameworks outlined in this book to get ahead in the
        game of life. And look at it this way: If you don’t understand and use the
        principles, you’ll continue to be surrounded by idiots. And nobody wants that</p>
